# Module 1: ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)

This module covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 as the nervous system of robots, including nodes, topics, services, actions, and how to integrate rclpy agents with humanoid URDF models.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for humanoid robotics applications
- Implement communication patterns using topics, services, and actions
- Integrate rclpy agents with humanoid robot models
- Define and visualize humanoid robot models using URDF

## Chapter Overview

- [Chapter 1: Nodes, Topics, Services](./chapter1-nodes-topics-services.md)
- [Chapter 2: rclpy Agent Integration](./chapter2-rclpy-integration.md)
- [Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids](./chapter3-urdf-humanoids.md)

## Why This Module Matters

This is foundational knowledge required for all other modules in the course and forms the backbone of modern robotics development.
