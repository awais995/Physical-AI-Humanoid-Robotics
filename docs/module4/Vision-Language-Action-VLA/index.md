# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) + Capstone

This module covers implementing voice-activated robotics systems using Whisper for voice commands, LLMs for cognitive planning, and voice-to-action pipelines, plus the capstone integration project.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Create systems that accept voice commands via Whisper
- Process commands through LLMs for cognitive planning
- Execute corresponding actions on humanoid robots
- Integrate all modules into a complete autonomous system

## Chapter Overview

- [Chapter 1: Whisper Voice Commands](./chapter1-whisper-commands.md)
- [Chapter 2: LLM-based Cognitive Planning](./chapter2-llm-planning.md)
- [Chapter 3: Voice-to-Action Pipelines](./chapter3-voice-to-action.md)
- [Chapter 4: Capstone Plagiarism Check](./chapter4-capstone-plagiarism-check.md)

## Why This Module Matters

This demonstrates mastery of all course concepts and provides a comprehensive project showcasing the full robotics pipeline from voice command to physical action.
