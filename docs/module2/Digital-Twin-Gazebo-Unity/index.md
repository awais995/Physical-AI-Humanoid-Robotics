# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)

This module covers creating and working with digital twin environments using Gazebo and Unity, including physics simulation, sensor modeling, and high-fidelity rendering for humanoid robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Create simulation environments with accurate physics properties
- Implement sensor models (LiDAR, depth, IMU) in simulation
- Validate that simulation behaves as expected compared to real-world physics
- Build high-fidelity rendering environments for humanoid robots

## Chapter Overview

- [Chapter 1: Gazebo and Unity Integration](./chapter1-gazebo-unity.md)
- [Chapter 2: Physics Simulation and Collisions](./chapter2-physics-simulation.md)
- [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation](./chapter3-sensors-simulation.md)

## Why This Module Matters

Simulation is crucial for testing robotics algorithms safely and cost-effectively before real-world deployment. Digital twins allow for rapid prototyping and validation of humanoid robot behaviors in a controlled environment.
